I admire the weeknoters amongst you, I really do. But I have neither the discipline or material to support that, so I'm going to try something else.

Month-notes? I'm going to talk about things that happened in the previous month, but also include music I heard, stuff I read etc. as I think if I gave you too deep a look into my work you might drift off.

I will play around with the format a bit as I go I expect, but for now, this is it.

## Thoughts
We've really started to tackle some of the foundational data architecture work that you otherwise put on the back-burner this month, working out what templating for enterprise data models and patterns will look like so that it's a useful tool for digital teams and policy teams alike. A pretty fine line but a good exercise in articulating what makes an entity important to your business – I'm hoping to share this in more detail over the next couple of months. If I am going to write about data models being institutional memory, then I really need to walk the walk as well.

I think we're very close to really getting to grips with one of our key reference data sets as well. Honestly, this stuff takes so long sometimes but it's all the better once you actually start.

I also feel like the team are getting to grips with objectives and key results as something that we do, although I still worry they aren't amibitious enough - but one person's ambitious is another person's terrifyingly impossible so I want to keep the team onside.

Work isn't half easier when you have a really supportive colleague you can vent to. Mine's [Diane](https://twitter.com/dianejaybee), who over the last year has put up with me pissing and moaning on several occasions, offered good advice, been a sounding board and suitably rolled her eyes at my BS when necessary. Don't get me wrong, nothing has been so tough at work that I've been regretful, and I love working where I do with the people I do, but it's never a bed of roses and everyone needs to vent.

Thanks Diane, you're ace and I appreciate you – saffron buns on me next time.

## Feelings
Getting older is one thing, I'll be 40 next year, and I am really okay with that. Being "fresh-faced" and not being able to join in with Movember or the general trend for all this cool facial hair I am used to.

Being "fresh-faced" whilst simultaneously beginning to go grey is pretty galling I must say. I feel like Benjamin effing Button.

## Words
Man oh man am I regretting not have a Trello or something where I noted down all the things I read this month. I did finish my first book of 2020 though - I find books a struggle attention span wise which creates this terrible inertia but once I get going I always enjoy it.

I read [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)) which some of you remember I bought when we originally were supposed to move house at the end of August, but like it said, interia.

I liked it. If I'm honest it didn't feel particularly science-fictiony to me but it is over 50 years old so I imagine back in the day it was pretty wild.

## Sounds
The YouTube channel I stumbled upon a few months back that plays all sorts of world music continues to play really interesting stuff, like this [Bollywood grooves set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4SxNIuRSQM).

[Trilly](https://twitter.com/TrillyC) recommended [Floating Features by La Luz](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nLb53kacZx9wR5qjxiWuXoKn-lI1p6vsw) which has this amazing surf rock sound. I'll be honest that when he described it in the pub it didn't exactly tickle my pickle but I really enjoyed it.

Another recommend from Paul (who assures me he has never twoc'd a train in his life) was [Ten Days of Blue by John Beltran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TU_APlC1EM) which is very much my kind of ambient.

Popped into my local record shop and they were playing something that sounded good, it was [Matching Head and Feet by Kevin Coyne](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mjYV0ga1evNCbvlw3wnk2nnDhC1AZmOIc). It was good, if you like that blues-rock sound that is.

Listened to [Crush by Floating Points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq6w-sPMnJE) again because the day after publishing my listens of 2019 blog, realised I had forgotten it and wanted to let it know I was sorry.

## Smells

## Tastes
We've been trying to eat more vegetarian and vegan meals lately, and we picked up [The Green Roasting Tin](https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/books/the-green-roasting-tin) because being a busy family it can sometimes be hard to find recipes that meet criteria for both complexity and time. When you have a three year old, you're having tea no later than half past five or you'll regret it.



## Fun
Last time I was in "that there London" I went for a drink with [Steve](https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser) and [Trilly](https://twitter.com/TrillyC) which had such good chat apparently I didn't look at my phone for over two hours and my wife got very worried. Trilly quoted about "design being the rendering of intent" while we were chatting and I've not been able to get it out of my head.

Does data lack design because it lacks intent altogether? Does it exist in this weird sort of space where it's just a bunch of observations of a process or system?

This is very unrefined and I will just leave it there for now. Honestly, sometimes it takes me weeks to iron out these things into a coherent sentence, let alone a coherent thought.

## Games
We've made it to October in [Pandemic: Legacy Season 1](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1) and things are getting nervy. For those that don't know, [Pandemic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic) is a co-operative board game where you have to try and save the world from various, er, pandemics. The legacy version is unique in that you play twelve month story arc and the rules, board and pieces change constantly, sometimes irreversibly, and once the twelve months is finished, the game cannot be repeated (although I _think_ you should end up with sort of working copy of regular Pandemic).

I appreciate that it might be a little close to home right now, but it's just a board game. I also think it would make a really interesting team building exercise - anyone done that?
