You thought I'd forgotten, hadn't you?

Absolutely not. My attempts to blog monthly may have failed in 2020, but I can at least try to make this an annual tradition.

## The list
Like last year's, it is in no particular order, and isn't limited to a specific number of albums. Unlike last year's it's all albums or EPs here, so no accompanying playlists this time. I've linked to YouTube full albums where possible.

I found it a bit harder to cobble together this year's list as I changed my phone a few months ago before realising I relied on my "recently added" list as a barometer of what I've enjoyed over the last year. I have really been digging deep into the old memory banks for this year.

Like last year, the only rule was to only include tracks I _heard_ for the first time in 2020.

### 1.  [Gordon Lightfoot - If You Could Read My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFWP148iP00)
I can't play a lick, but I love watching [Rick Beato's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/pegzch), especially his excellent "What Makes This Song Great" series. This was one of them.

### 2.  [Freddie Gibbs & The Alchemist - Alfredo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu6lCtQ-yUg&list=OLAK5uy_lO8T1fPdsSOlvoOEudiL9Ao6PQK6A6YKI)
I love the Freddi and Madlib stuff, and this is right up there too. I really love Freddie's rapping (although it may be an acquired taste) and the production here is top notch.

### 3.  [Scott Walker - Scott 4](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsj1k0hgg382M1mx1TCPxEcRJOqFHCeJp)
Scott Walker was always ones of those "influential" artists I never got around to listening to, and I corrected that this year. I loved the contrast of that storytelling songwriting style and the smooth delivery.

### 4. [Daniel Avery - Love + Light](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLooEbOnESvVGGngroDuvqKnGAKWswi4-x)
I liked his previous album, and I like this one too. Thoughtful electronica.

### 5.  [Daniel Avery & Alessandro Cortini - Illusion of Time](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLooEbOnESvVGvmRWtzB2TwH9qYwpPM8aA)
This is a match made in heaven for me, and possibly the most exciting collaboration to hit my ears until that Four Tet // Madlib record comes out.

### 6.  [Against All Logic - 2017-2019](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ9EDNklu8XT7NIJPLpEMvPDmgYZYze8l)
The second of Nicolas Jaar's alter ego records isn't as good as the first in my opinion, but gets close.

### 7.  [YOB - Our Raw Heart](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l4W3g6kiBOp-qDwCkEbN4Btgv0-5qEZfA)
It's something metal! ðŸ¤˜

### 8.  [Moses Boyd - Dark Matter](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSRkGe311PSJ7bp7GUHH0Dei1zBpcgDMH)
Listening to a lot more jazz in the last few years means I am no longer missing out on great albums like this.

### 9.  [Fontaines D.C. - A Hero's Death](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nGZVDEsNI_3DfnCWteRyrA9YaaurQcSnE)
I must admit, I found their first album just okay, but this one I liked a lot more.

### 10. [Run the Jewels - RTJ4](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mvMCZYpjEuV-jZUZs_6AH2ErVgQaDGn0Q)
I've been a firm admirer of RTJ and El-P's production for a while now, and this one did not disappoint.

### 11. [Nubya Garcia - SOURCE](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLddSkUxmPEC-f9Ly6O1i_YdMzXHE_9EPR)
More incredible jazz from 2020.

### 12. [Kelly Lee Owens - Inner Song](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mdxim3aNXoW8d2EDR_SoaEU8D9HG4WhRg)
This is a wonderful layered thing and might be my favourite new album from 2020.

### 13. [Idles - Ultra Mono](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lHXccxNwEpUFxCATfBuxtDUml-DnLFC_A)
Idles continuing their trend of making records that are like a really aggressive hug.

### 14. [Nicolas Jaar - Cenizas](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ly0m5pAgAmp2Upt14ruifTMrQhOuMSglE)
Jaar released this and another more ambient/experiemental album in 2020 called Telas (along with the A.A.L. stuff), this one is my favourite.

### 15. [Fazer Drums - Sound Measures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_tBAnM3lww)
Pretty sure this was another one I picked up from Mary Anne Hobbs' show.

### 16. [Sophia Loizou - Untold](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kUuJErdCciTE1x9NJWhJFJG69D3QIVzjg)
[Paul](https://twitter.com/PaulMcG59) put me on to this and I immediately started recommending it to all and sundry, which now includes you. Before this I hadn't realised that ambient jungle was a thing but I m very glad it is.

### 17. [Surprise Chef - Daylight Savings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nqBak_4WDfOJoVBXGHXuHPp5JrpHBbfj0)
While it looks like BADBADNOTGOOD have called it a day (for now at least), Australian four piece Surprise Chef have filled the lounge jazz void nicely. This is their sophomore effort, but I also heard their debut, All News Is Good News, this year too. I can recommend both.

### 18. [Conforce - Dawn Chorus](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lniPczebZcSMM93H4ppi4Nh7HvzaXGwkw)
Nice, ambient, techno.

### 19. [Redeyes - Unfinished Theory (EP)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m0jfgY_-hjbkwwGWsenBrtGGl4DMCLJ_8)
Picked this one up from one of [Steve's](https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser) monthly recommendation lists. I am not a drum and bass expert, but I liked this a lot.

### 20. [Gidge - New Light](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGQEoEJczL_8tWCTBINAZNS99f3cjsHpO)
Twitter remains a total cesspool, only redeemed by occasional music recommends like this one I picked up from [Leigh](https://twitter.com/ldodds) and occsional wholesome flask related content ([not from Leigh](https://twitter.com/dasbarrett/status/1342499001518718976?s=20)).

### 21. [Bongzilla - Gateway](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3-iPaP3XFQJ9Qcz3r82S63UZcJYM5y1h)
I had never heard of this band before a few weeks ago. Another from twitter and despite being about as subtle as a sledgehammer packs a suitably fuzzy punch.

Well, I hope some of you like some of these and they're new to you. Closest I get to a personal public service this one. Here's hoping for more great listens in 2021.

Cheers 'n' gone.
