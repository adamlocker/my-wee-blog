I didn't post once in 2021. I have a couple of drafts half-heartedly, half-finished I might get around to in 2022, but I thought the least I could do was give some folks some record recommendations.

## The list
Like last year's, it is in no particular order, but I have once again a list of 21 records, so I guess that's a thing now.

Looking back at last years list, I think 2021 was full of records I liked even more, it's been a really strong year for music I've liked. 

Like last year, the only rule is to only include tracks/albums I _heard_ for the first time in 2021, but looking at the list, most of these were new releases, and they're all albums.

I'm no music critic, and I need to get this done while a lasagne is cooking so I have tried to be brief. Your time is important to me. :-)

### 1.  [Mastodon - Hushed and Grim](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nSWNd2yXhWWBzdXIbxo-wgkdF-i6f2fTo)
Woo! Mastodon are back. I'll be honest, I didn't enjoy Emperor of Sand or Once More 'Round the Sun, but this is just the right level of "prog" for me, some nice stuff.

### 2.  [Floating Points & Pharoah Sanders - Promsies](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m1EDXdgXNWy7O8O8kzJEK4pRCMybbqgIk)
I think this is my favourite record of 2021. I adore every second of it.

### 3.  [Hannah Holland - Tectonic](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n-9AY7ywinA1qPUqCxwSimIS7ugmgAE7w)
I felt like I'd been waiting ages for this record since hearing a track from it on the Radio. It didn't disappoint.

### 4.  [Haina Rani - Home](https://youtu.be/TapgyJP-nDM)
I haven't listened to this recently, so don't have any vivid feedback, but I know it should be on this list.

### 5.  [Black Country, New Road - For the first time](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mMlGvmb6bLlM4Vy4zJrLD2xly51BHe9nk)
I heard about this record at the start of the year, but didn't get around to listening to it until a few months ago. I regret that.

### 6.  [Ishmael Ensemble - Visions of Light](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mt4fUL1P8M5pdIUBXHM8STaDKUp2RTe2c)
Listened to this after seeing Huey recommend it as his favourite album of 2021 and really enjoyed it.

### 7.  [Jessy Lanza - DJ Kicks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAArUShcYEBRTHVhn45psbq_30lIDriL)
I don't love every DJ Kicks release, but I really like this one (and most of the others if I'm honest).

### 8.  [Jon Hopkins - Music For Psychedelic Therapy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nygXZjUpwQJ0j2Ojs0FkzuZflDM2lUh1M)
Ambient(er) Hopkins.

### 9.  [BADBADNOTGOOD - Talk Memory](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lvO6GZoZCONeTw0ZmKw_bEL9bQOfL0DHg)
My favourite BBNG album is III, which this is a bit closer to than IV was.

### 10. [Japanese Breakfast - Sable (Original Video Game Soundtrack)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nlLv7jiLD2kbeShmT3kpmxTzOcTqbjCi0)
I also recommend Sable, the game this is from. It has a very chilled, non-combative experience with some nice visuals and a focus on exploration.

### 11. [Hannah Peel - Fir Wave](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lJWvuYx4bmZOrX2WTR42eBLjqnuWhy60k)
2021 had a high bar set by Hannahs. Well done Hannahs.

### 12. [Gotts Street Park - Diego](https://youtu.be/0YHqBBdBvAs)
I think this was an algorithm recommendation, but it's a good one. Jazz from Leeds.

### 13. [DARKSIDE - Spiral](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxA687tYuMWgFdwONNw7ba8GpQfjHUJof)
Had been quite eagerly anticipating this record for a while and it didn't disappoint.

### 14. [Black Midi - Cavalcade](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kUnskQcRsXYKRx_gPeeYNoPAnMemYyE18)
This sophomore effort keeps up the standard set by the first.

### 15. [Charlotte Day Wilson - Alpha](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mM3AaJMTYHVOesXzlqQasL1iKuN7bByPk)
Smooth and soulful, a little bit rich. Like a nice sticky toffee pudding.

### 16. [Les Filles de Illighadad - Eghass Malan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKmjcJMI5UA)
Came by this recommendation from a Canadian.

### 17. [Alessandro Cortini - Scuro Chiaro](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mWigyJ7jh7T7OOhbW8gY484wS8k_kJHSo)
I love pretty much all of Cortini's stuff, and this minimalist record is lovely.

### 18. [El P - Capone OST](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kPS4pkiDmFvTVer6iY6xZvyAvrJyhgNkw)
Somewhat surprisingly I think the best drone record I've heard this year is El-P's soundtrack to the Tom Hardy Capone biopic.

### 19. [Viagra Boys - Welfare Jazz)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ltEHn5xX9KHc3JLnoK8Uzeb1vd6se5v0o)
I remember listening to this and thinking that it didn't sound like I had expected from the title, and that putting expectations on artistic endeavour is rude and I shouldn't do it.

### 20. [Om Unit - Acid Dub Studies](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ltZmJ7eMKys6skEM77LTIj3voIWBp4L2o)
Thanks again to perennial recommender, "Paul from work" for this one.

### 21. [Bonobo - Fragments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1lAX8PFPO8)
This'll be played to death in every single hipster bar in the country, which comes with the territory I guess, but I still really enjoy this style of music, especially for work listening.

If someone reads this, listens to something they've not heard before, and likes it then that's a real result and would make me enormously happy.

Wishing you all well and good listening 2022.

Lasagne time.
