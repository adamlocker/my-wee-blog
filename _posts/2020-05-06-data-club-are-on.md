excerpt: The first rule of data club is it's "are on" not "is on". Apparently.

![data club has a motto](/my-wee-blog/images/data-club.png)

Data club is a joke. Literally. It was a shorthand for "anyone want to go to the pub and probably talk about data".

It was mainly aimed at the folks who I already went to the pub with because I like going to the pub. At least when I am away from home and feel like a lonely Cornish bumpkin in the capital.

But then a bunch of other nice, interesting and interested people said they would like to data club but the pub wasn't for them or that time didn't work. The problem with nice and interesting people being nice and interested in something you want to do is that you kind of have to do it. These people are nice and interesting and I hate letting them down.

So data club is happening (are happening?)

## What ~is~ are data club?

Data club is a place where **you** can come and talk about data. More specifically, you can ask for help with, or a sympathetic ear to, your data problem.

Data club will try and be pragmatic forum where you can come with a question and you might get a useful answer, we might even get some bona fide experts turn up.

## How will it work?

We will meet for an hour, virtually this time.

We will source questions from attendees.

Attendees will vote on the ones they find most interesting, and we will talk about them.

Rinse and repeat until our hour is up!

I have just stolen this wholesale from OneTeamGov breakfast events that I have attended but imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

## When will it happen?

Wednesday 13 May, from 1700 - 1800.

## Where will it happen?

There will be a Google Meet, er, meeting. Here's a [link](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NTFtbWd0bjBvNHM5MmhlbDJidnQzazc1ZTAgYWRhbS5sb2NrZXJAZm9vZC5nb3YudWs&tmsrc=adam.locker%40food.gov.uk) to it!

And here's a wee button thing to add it to your diary.

## Chatham house rules?

I'm sure it does. I've never been.

Also, no. As this is public and open to anyone we can't promise anything. If needs be you may have to abstract your question a bit.

## How do we ask a question?

There will be a google doc, where you can go type your question in. The link we be shared about 30 minutes before data club and during the meeting.

## Will there be stickers?

Almost certainly, but right now posting out stickers are just an unmodelled vector so you'll need to hold your horses.

## I have other questions you haven't answered here

You are welcome to contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/chairlord) and I will attempt to answer your question. Although to be honest I am winging pretty much all of this. Data club, not life. Well, maybe life. Who knows?
